Cognify is an app that helps you improve your cognitive functions such as Concentration, Attention and Relaxation.

This project leverages an OpenBCI Cyton board to acquire EEG data from a wearable headset, processing the signals using an ESP32 microcontroller to determine levels of attention, concentration, and stress. 

The processed data is visualized in real-time through a Flutter-based application, in a dynamic graphical representations that allows users to train their concentration and relaxation techniques by allowing them to view in which state they're in(e.g Beta, Alpha). 

Users get daily challenges; for example to stay in a concentration state for a defined period of time. The challenge results and the data is displayed on a dashboard and stored on the MultiversX blockchain where the users own it and can decide to share/sell it for research purposes.

Tech Stack:
BCI Integration: Python + Supabase
Signal processing: Flutter + Supabase
Dashboard: React + Typescript
MultiversX SC: Rust
